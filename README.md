# 👋 Hi there, I'm Victoria!

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me
- I am a BSc Physics student interested in creating delicious code aiding in improving experimental set ups as well as performing valuable analysis on the collected data.
- Coding is not my strongest suit but I adore the challenge, and creativity problem solving builds when tackling issues from a computer science perspective. 
- When I'm not struggling with advanced mechanics or debugging very simple code, I love hiking 🏞️, reading about Greco-Roman history 📚, and playing piano 🎹. 

## 🌱 I'm Learning...
