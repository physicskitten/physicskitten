### Hi there, I'm Victoria!

## About Me
I am a Bsc Physics student at Queen Mary University of London interested in creating cool code to aid and improve experimental set ups and results. Coding is not my strongest suit but I adore the challenge and creativity problem solving builds when tackling issues from a computer science perspective. I predominantly use python but also love to tinker with arduinos and the C++ language.
When I'm not struggling with advanced mechanics or debugging very simple code, I love to go hiking 🏞️, read about Greek and Roman history 📚, and play piano 🎹.
