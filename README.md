# 👋 Hi there, I'm Victoria!

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me
- I am a BSc Physics student interested in creating delicious code to aid in improving experimental set ups and performing valuable analysis.
- Coding is not my strongest suit but I adore the challenge and creativity problem solving builds when tackling issues from a computer science perspective. 
- When I'm not struggling with advanced mechanics or debugging very simple code, I love hiking 🏞️, reading about Greco-Roman history 📚, and playing piano 🎹. 

## 🌱 I'm Learning...
### 🌿 My Baby Projects
- Self taught python :)
- [Multiple object tracking](https://github.com/physicskitten/droplet_tracker_original) using the hungarian algorithm and ROI selection with complimenting documentation such as a [formal report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11-QX8NEb5vwFQukSnY2XJyiJbV_Xg-Il/view?usp=sharing) and [poster presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MCC3CFQDR6DohqRu_8i6pBed4x-MZc2q/view?usp=sharing).
- Presentation of data and analyses primarily with health data such as [patient information](https://github.com/physicskitten/Patient-Information-Study), [air quality](https://github.com/physicskitten/Air-Quality-Study) and [heath disparities](https://github.com/physicskitten/Health-Disparities-Study)
- [Correlation matrix heatmap](https://github.com/physicskitten/Chemical-Compounds-Analysis) for chemical analysis and formula parser
